<h1 id="res">RESTAURANT</h1>
<p id="res1">The 2017 Sydney Morning Herald Good Food Restaurant of the Year, Quay is one of Australia’s most awarded and celebrated restaurants.</br></br>
 Set in the heart of Sydney Harbour, Quay has arguably the best views of any restaurant in Australia, with spectacular panoramic views 
 </br></br>taking in Circular Quay,
 the Sydney Opera House and the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Captivating the imagination of critics and the dining </br></br>public alike is Quay’s nature-based menu created
                                                 by Executive - Chef Peter Gilmore</p>

   <h1 id="res">REVIEWS</h1>
     <p id="res1">It is a year of divide-and-conquer for Quay; as chef Peter Gilmore takes on the challenge of the new Bennelong dining room in the Sydney Opera House as well as 
     this razzle-dazzle harbor side restaurant. But Quay still sets the benchmark for some of the most exquisite and articulate food in Australia: textural, botanical, 
     micro seasonal, full of grace and dangerously easy to pair with an equally fine wine…</p></br>
     <p id="res1">Quay is all about a succession of plates that arrest the palate as potently as they do they eye, the whole package
     framed by the harbour panorama beyond the glass and the sort of professional service and luxe fittings inside that such high prices demand</p></br>
      <p id="res1">As ever, the open warm service adds a special note to what is still Australia’s most desirable restaurant view. In short, Quay shoes not a whiff of complacency.
     It’s still one of the stellar dining experiences of Australia.</p></br>
