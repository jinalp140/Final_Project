      friendly hospitality with creative, market-driven food. Executive Chef Jeremy Salamonâ€™s menu incorporates Indian and Persian influences and at the same time,<br>
      explores his indo-Carabbian roots through the adaptation of recipes passed down in his family for generations. If you want to ask Jeremy what all that means, <br>
      you can find him at Union Square Market most mornings. The short answer is, delicious.The Eddy's wine list features a rotating list of wines by<br>
      the glass and 75 wines by the bottle.&nbsp;The focus is on small,&nbsp;conscientious wine-makers. Wines are represented from both the classic, well-known appellations in Indian<br>
      and the USA,&nbsp;while at the same time explores new regions, winemakers and lesser-known varietals.&nbsp;The goal is to offer fun,&nbsp;exciting,<br> high-quality and delicious wines that pair well with the cuisine.
      Original cocktails are designed, prepared and poured by Head Bartender Brian Elder.&nbsp;The space was designed by the lovely and talented artist Josh Sedore.</p></div>
