friendly hospitality with creative, market-driven food. Executive Chef Jeremy Salamonâ€™s menu incorporates European and Mediterranean influences and at the same time,
 explores his Hungarian roots through the adaptation of recipes passed down in his family for generations. If you want to ask Jeremy what all that means, 
 you can find him at Union Square Market most mornings. The short answer is, delicious.The Eddy's wine list features a rotating list of wines by
 the glass and 75 wines by the bottle.&nbsp;The focus is on small,&nbsp;conscientious wine-makers. Wines are represented from both the classic, well-known appellations in Europe 
 and the USA,&nbsp;while at the same time explores new regions, winemakers and lesser-known varietals.&nbsp;The goal is to offer fun,&nbsp;exciting, high-quality and delicious wines that pair well with the cuisine.
