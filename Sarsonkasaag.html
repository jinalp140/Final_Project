<h1>SARSON KA SAAG<h1>
<p>Sarson da saag (Sarson ka saag, in Hindi, Urdu) is a popular vegetarian dish from the Punjab region of India and Pakistan, made from mustard greens (sarson) and spices.
The dish is regarded as the traditional way to prepare saag and is usually served with makki di roti (literally "unleavened corn bread".[1] It can be topped with either butter (unprocessed white or processed yellow butter) or more traditionally with ghee (clarified butter). Some spinach (called palak in Hindi) may be added to enhance colour and thicken the dish, though this may alter the flavor.[2]
Mustard is a winter and spring delicacy, and its relative abundance in Punjab, Rajasthan, and North-East has made it one of the most popular dishes in those regions.
